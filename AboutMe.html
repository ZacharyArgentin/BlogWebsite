                    Golf is my favourite sport. As soon as I learned how to walk (actually probably even before that!) my dad was teaching me how to swing a golf club.
                    I currently play to a 10 handicap. Arguably I should be better considering how long I've been playing but hey, 
                    It's a tough sport!

                <h2>Languages</h2>
                <p>
                    Another hobby of mine is learning languages. In high school and college I studied spanish. As a result 
                    I can read and write in spanish quite well, although I can only speak it semi-fluently as I have never
                    had the opportunity to immerse myself in a spanish speaking culture. I will occasionally watch youtube 
                    videos and read articles / books in spanish to keep my spanish skills fresh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    English is my native language, so I consider myself lucky in that learning a new language isn't typically 
                    required when travelling, as English has become somewhat of a global lingua franca. However I still like
                    to learn as much as I can about a language before visiting a foreign country. Languages that I have at 
                    basic least a basic knowledge of include;
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spanish</li>
                        <li>Greek</li>
                        <li>Italian</li>
                        <li>French</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have varying degrees of skill levels in these languages and varying reasons for wanting to learn each
                    of them.
                    I'd like to become more adept at speaking French and Italian; French because as a Canadian I'd like to
                    speak both of our official languages, and Italian because my granparents on my dad's side are Italian.
                    With regard to Greek I've been casually learning it since I took a trip to Greece in April 2023. It's a 
                    challenge for me because it's the first non-romance language that I've attempted to learn, although it was 
                    actually a precursor to (and therefore also an influence to latin), so their are some similarities.
                    Lastly although I would categorize myself as an advanced speaker of Spanish, I'd like to become more 
                    conversationally fluent. That will require more listening and speaking practice, so that I can understand
                    and speak the most common words / phrases without having to think about it at all.

                <p lang="es">
                    Un pasatiempo mío es estudiar idiomas. Estudiaba español en el colegio y la universidad. Por lo tanto 
                    puedo leer y escribir español bastante bien. Pero no lo puedo hablar con soltura, debido a no poder 
                    pasar bastante tiempo en un país hispanohablante. En el futuro quisiera mejorar mi habilidad de hablarlo.
                    Lo importante es que sigo estudiàndo los idiomas para mejorar. Como dijò Pablo Picasso, <q>La acción 
                    es la clave fundamental para tódo éxito.</q> En mis palabras, digo <q>Si Haces algo otra vez y otra vez,     
                    con un actitud implacable, no se puede fallar.</q>
