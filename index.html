          Hi! My name is Zachary Argentin. I love learning new things. I built this website to practice my HTML, CSS, and 
          Javascript skills.

            Microsoft Azure. If you have any freelance work or other inquiries, feel free to email me!

          <h2 id="article1">An ancient greek aphorism to live by</h2>
          <h5>May 19, 2023</h5>

          <h4><q>We are what we repeatedely do</q> - Aristotle<sup>1</sup> </h4>
          <p>
            While I was on vacation in Greece I bought a coffee mug with this pearl of wisdom written on it. I thought it was 
            clever because of course, the morning coffee is a well-known daily ritual for many. But I also thought it would act
            as a good daily reminder.
          </p> 
          <ul>
            <li>The reminder is that my current situation in life is largely the result of my previous actions.</li> 
            <li>The reminder is that I can guide my life towards a desirable future by repeatedly doing things that get me closer to that future state.</li>
            <li>The reminder is that positive change doesn't require a herculean effort, it simply requires small, consistent, repeated decisions to change.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Now the concept that making a small consistent effort over time in order to acheive great things isn't foreign to me; 
            I've heard it expressed in a number of different ways. <q>Where you're attention goes, energy flows, and so goes 
            the direction of your life</q>, is one that I've heard before. Or the notion of doing at least one thing every day
            that progresses you towards a goal, and keeping track of the streak on a calendar.<sup>2</sup> 
            However for some reason seeing it being worded so simply really struck a chord with me. 
          </p>
          <blockquote class="feature-text"><em><q>We are what we repeatedely do</q></em></blockquote>
          <p>
            I've really taken this bit of wisdom to heart since learning about it. I'm making a consistent effort on doing things
            that make me proud to be who I am. One of those things is working on skills and projects related to my career. 3 of 
            those skills are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; and this website is one of those projects! 
            Currently I am a data analyst / business analyst. I also assist with software reliability monitoring. I'd like to one day move 
            toward data engineering / data science / solution architecture. And this aphorism has helped me believe that if I apply 
            myself and learn a little bit every day then I will be able to get there!
          </p>

            1. I later learned that what I love most about this aphorism - it's simplicity and eloquence - actually can't be 
            attributed to Aristotle. It turns out the Will Durant, author of a 1926 book <cite>"The story of Philosophy"</cite>, 
            was paraphrasing in is own words what he thought was the essence of one of Aristotle's many teachings. So thank you 
            Will Durant!

            2. Apparently Jerry Seinfeld did with his goal of creating what became one of the most watched sit coms of all time.
